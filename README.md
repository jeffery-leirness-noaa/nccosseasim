## Overview

The `nccosseasim` package provides a suite of functions for running
simulations to inform sampling design decisions within the NOAA National
Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Seascape Ecology and Analytics
(SEA) branch. It includes tools for simulating compositional data,
analyzing simulation results, and visualizing outcomes to support
sampling design and data collection decisions.

## Features

- Simulate compositional data for ecological analyses
- Run simulations with different parameterizations
- Compare metrics across simulation scenarios
- Fit Dirichlet models to compositional data
- Visualize simulation results with customizable plotting functions

## Installation

You can install the development version of nccosseasim from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeffery-leirness-noaa/nccosseasim")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(nccosseasim)

# Example code will go here
# simulate_comp_data()
# run_simulation()
# plot_comp_data()
```

## Getting help

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible
example on GitHub.
